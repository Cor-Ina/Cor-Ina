👋 **Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br> My current work involves translating modern designs created by 
<br> [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) into accessible, responsive, and pixel-perfect websites.

Please visit **[my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina)** to learn more about my work.
<br>I **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, <br>especially on features related to accessibility.



<br>🛠 **My tools:**
- CSS, BEM
- A11y
- JavaScript
- Figma + Sketch

<br>📚 **Currently learning: React, Sass**

- Quick link to my current React project, **NEAT NOTES**, a Desktop notes app:

[<img alt="Screenshot of Notes app in dark mode" src="./images/NeatNotes.jpg" width="500" height="auto">](https://neatnotes.netlify.app/)
<br>Features I'm tinkering with:
- adding several font color options for the dark mode layout
- mobile-friendly design


<br>♿️ **My favorite resources on learning about accessibility:**
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
                         
<br>👷 **I am open to collaborating on a11y / CSS / JavaScript / React projects.**
