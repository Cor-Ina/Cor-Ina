👋 Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.
<br>
<br> My current work involves translating modern designs created by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
<br> into accessible, responsive, and pixel-perfect websites.

Please visit [my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina) to learn more about my work.
<br>I welcome questions or suggestions on how to improve my code, especially on features related to accessibility.

🛠 My tools:
- CSS, BEM
- A11y
- JavaScript
- Figma + Sketch

📚 Currently learning: React, Sass


♿️ My favorite resources on learning about accessibility:
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
                         
👷 I am open to collaborating on a11y / CSS / JavaScript / React projects.
